### Querier Testing

Querier returns a list which states the number of matches for a given query ranked. For querier to be a good program, it needs to consistently output the same results given the same data


the querier should be able to handle many different cases because it is a small equivalent of a google search.


### Additional Info
Results could also be manually evaluated. I used the output from a directory from the CS50 account on the server for testing.
